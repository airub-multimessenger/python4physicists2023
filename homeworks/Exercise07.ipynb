    "Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns. It deals with orders in special dynamic systems whose temporal development appears unpredictable, although the underlying equations are actually deterministic.\n",

    "The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in Texas can cause a tornado in Brazil. \n",
    "In 1960, Edward Norton Lorenz worked on numerical weather prediction, which relied on computers to forecast weather by processing observational data on such things as temperature, pressure, and wind. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. Lorenz observed that this small variation in the initial data of the variables in his simple weather model produced very different weather forecast results. This sensitive dependence on the initial conditions became known as the butterfly effect.\n",
