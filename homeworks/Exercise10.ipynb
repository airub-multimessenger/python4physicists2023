Neutrinos from far sources travel so long distances that when they arrive at Earth highly mixed, their flavor composition is $\\nu_e : \\nu_\\mu : \\nu_\\tau = 1:1:1$ no matter what was their composition at the source. Most of the detectors, hovewer, are very sensitive to only one flavor and have much worse sensitivity to all other flavors, therefore, it is roughly the same at taking only 1/3 of all-flavor neutrino flux."
